## About

This project started when I got a Thermal Printer from a friend. I don't really know if you can do anything more, but I guess it's fun.


## Installation

To make this project work, you will need :
- [A Thermal Printer]( https://www.adafruit.com/product/597 )
- A Raspberry Pi
- Some electric wires.

Start by following the guide [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/networked-thermal-printer-using-cups-and-raspberry-pi) to install the CUPS software needed to print images. You can also get some information from [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/mini-thermal-receipt-printer) and [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/instant-camera-using-raspberry-pi-and-thermal-printer) if you're stuck.

Then, setup the project :
```
git clone https://github.com/N07070/LittlePrynter
cd LittlePrynter
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Now, edit `the users.json` and add a user. **Don't forget to remove the test user.**

You can now start the web server with

```
export FLASK_APP=littleprynter.py
flask run
```

Voil√† !
